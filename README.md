<h1>AirForecast open source project</h1>
</div>


AirForecast was designed to collect and visualize air quality data, as well as predict future values using the ([Holt-Winters](https://www.pmorgan.com.au/tutorials/holt-winters-method-and-northam-temperature-data/) model. It utilizes InfluxDB as a database for storing data and Grafana for visualizing the values. Additionally, it has two RGB LEDs to visualize the AQI without looking at your screen, so you can easily tell when your air quality is good or bad. This project was inspired by the increasing frequency of wildfires worldwide. AirForecast helps users stay informed about air quality and potential health risks.
